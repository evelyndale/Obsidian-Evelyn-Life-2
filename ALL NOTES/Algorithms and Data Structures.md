# Time Complexity

## Big O 
### Notation
- O for upper bound
- $\Omega$ for lower bound
 
### Reduction
- $O(n)$ and $O(n/2)$ are close enough to be reduced to $O(n)$
- $O(log_2$n) is essentially O(log n), as the base is a small enough mathematical detail that it can be simplified for big o purposes

### Common Running Times
- $O(n^2)$
- $O(n\ log\ n)$
- $O(n)$$
- $O(log\ n)$
- $O(1)$
