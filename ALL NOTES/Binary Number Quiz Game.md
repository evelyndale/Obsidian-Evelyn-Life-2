## Concept
Make a CLI game that prompts with either a decimal or binary number and asks user to provide the other representation of that number

## Tools
- Bash, C, Python, or JS
- Decimal / Binary conversion library if needed

# To Do
- Look up process for converting between decimal and binary to see how hard it is to build myself or if I should use a library
