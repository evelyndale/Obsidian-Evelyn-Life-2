Village Theme, Lost Woods, or Wake Up

### Wake Up 
- repeating scene of person repeatedly getting up from bed, close up, but with each loop with the camera pulls back and to the side, revealing that she gets out of bed and falls then repeatedly keeps getting off ground and falling
- hazy first or third person stumbling outside 
- intermittent hazy dream sequences
- ends with being awakened by the train voice
-
