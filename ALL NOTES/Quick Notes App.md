## Concept
Quickly add an idea to my MarkDown note collection through the terminal

## Outline
- Enter a terminal command that inserts text into either a new or existing md file, and uses tags or prompts to automatically add the note to a logical place
- example: `quicknote add "Check out this new song (url-to-song)" #entertainment-list` automatically adds text in quotes to a note correlating with the hashtag

## Tools
Bash, probably
Markdown library
