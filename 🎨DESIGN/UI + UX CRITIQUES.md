Apple store not autoMATICALLY hilighting search bar when hit search

Stop putting a "get started" button on your page! i don't know if it's going to automatically download something, take me to a setup tutorial, or take me to a login or subscription page!

on web.dev, this horizontal scroll uses a dark draggable bar against a light background, exactly the opposite of the vertical scroll which is a light bar on a dark background. so the horizontal scroll is the opposite of what it seems! ini this case, the bar is scrolled all the way to the right, when it looks like it's scrolled to the left!
